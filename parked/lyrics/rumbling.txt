Rumbling, rumbling, it's coming
Rumbling, rumbling

Beware

Coming for you

All I ever wanted to do was do right things
I never wanted to be the king, I swear
All I ever wanted to do was save your life
I never wanted to grab a knife, I swear

I'm tearless, I'm fearless, I'm burning, I'm burning

You tell me what have I missed
Still wandering in the deep mist

If I lose it all, slip and fall
I will never look away
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
If I lose it all outside the wall
Live to die another day
I don't want anything
I'm just here to

Beware!

All I ever wanted to do was know: What's out there?
I refused to lose without a fight
We're just too young, ignorant and innocent
Like kids stay up all night in a tent
How do you see me?
Am I who I used to be?

Beware!

Nobody knows what's inside of me
Nobody knows what's inside of me
Nobody knows what's inside of me
I'm

If I lose it all, slip and fall
Will you laugh at me?
If I lose it all, lose it all

If I lose it all, slip and fall
I will never look away
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
If I lose it all outside the wall
Live to die another day
I don't want anything
I'm just here to

Beware!

Rumbling, rumbling, it's coming!
Rumbling, rumbling

Coming for you

Rumbling rumbling it's coming!
Rumbling, rumbling
